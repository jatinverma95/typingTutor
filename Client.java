				"Sandra Anne Morgan (born 6 June 1942) is a former freestyle swimmer for Australia who won gold in the 4×100-metre freestyle relay at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. At the age of 14 years and 6 months, she became the youngest Australian to win an Olympic gold medal, a record that still stands. Morgan's selection for the race raised controversy because of her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of false starts. In her only individual event, she came sixth in the 400-metre freestyle. In 1957, she won the 110-, 220-, and 440-yard treble at the Australian Championships in the absence of her main rivals. She was selected in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games as a relay swimmer, winning gold in the event. Since her retirement from competitive swimming in 1960, she has taught disabled children to swim and participated in Olympic educational programs and torch relays. She is also an ambassador for Australia Day and has appeared on television as part of her work with Christian groups");
